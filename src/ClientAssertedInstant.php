/**
 * The instant a client says the work happened, recorded beside the server's own and never in place of it.
 *
 * A terminal that captures a sale on Friday and submits it on Monday is asserting something the platform
 * cannot check: its own clock. Decision D14 requires that such a claim have a declared place to live, and
 * this is that place. The type exists so the assertion can be carried, read and audited without ever
 * being mistaken for the authoritative instant — `BusinessRecordService` keeps stamping every row from
 * its injected clock, and nothing here replaces that.
 *
 * **What this instant is never used for**, because a client's clock cannot be trusted with any of it:
 *
 * - **Ordering.** Events are ordered by allocated sequence, which is a server-side fact. A document
 *   captured earlier and submitted later is ordered where it arrived, and its capture instant explains
 *   the gap rather than reopening the sequence. Arrival order is not capture order and neither is
 *   negotiable by a caller.
 * - **Expiry.** An idempotency claim's replay and retention horizons run from the server's instant, so a
 *   terminal cannot lengthen its own replay window by asserting a later capture.
 * - **Period assignment.** Which accounting period a document falls in is decided from server-held
 *   declarations, so a client cannot post into a period by asserting a date inside it.
 * - **Numbering.** A document number is allocated by the receiving command from a server-side counter,
 *   so capture order can never reorder a statutory sequence.
 *
 * `ClientAssertedInstantBoundaryTest` proves each of those mechanically rather than leaving them as
 * intentions: it enumerates the paths that consume an instant for one of those four decisions and fails
 * the build if any of them can reach this type.
 *
 * **Late and out-of-order arrival is accepted, not tolerated as an edge case.** A command carrying a
 * capture instant days behind the server's is an ordinary command: it is validated, numbered, sequenced
 * and audited exactly as one captured a second ago, and the assertion is recorded so a reader can tell
 * the two apart afterwards.
